# Property Price Prediction

This project predicts property prices based on various features using a Ridge regression model. The workflow includes:

Data Preparation: Load and preprocess property data.
Feature Selection: Identify relevant features and target variables.
Model Training: Build and fit a pipeline with OneHotEncoder and Ridge regression.
Evaluation: Compute Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for model performance.
Prediction Function: Create a function to predict prices for new data.
